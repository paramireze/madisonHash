			  <h2>What is Hashing</h2>
			  <p>On a hash run, a "Hare" sets a trail unknown to the rest of the
					hashers. The idea is to find the trail, which leads to the beer and then to
					the party. The trail may lead almost anywhere through the woods,
					railroad tracks, alleys, mudholes, and bars. Wearing your nice new $300
					pair of running shoes would be bad. During a hash, Hashers are referred
					to by their <a href="roster.html">hash names</a>. There are many ways to <a href="http://half-mind.com/Hashing/who.htm#2">describe the Hash House Harriers</a> but it combines Running, Drinking, singing, eating and socializing. If you thought this might be a pleasant way to lose some weight,
					sorry, a hash is a net calorie gain.

			  <h2>Madison Style</h2>
			  <p>The Madison Hash House Harriers sets a hash trail every Saturday regardless of the outside conditions. Madison always has at least one beer check on each of its runs. Food is tyically served afterwards at a bar or someone's home. Ceremonies includes singing and giving away <a href="hashstuff.html">hash
				paraphernalia</a> for notable trangressions during the run. This is a coed hash and we welcome runners of all abilities, adult ages
				and degrees of ugliness. Leave the kids at home. Runs generally start at 3:00 PM during the winter and 5:00 PM during daylight saving time. The trail generally  is from 3 to 5 miles if you don't make any wrong turns. <a href="http://run-down.com/index.php?cat_id=389">MH3 is listed in the Run-Down running portal</a>.

			  <h2>Cheesehead Full Moon</h2>
			  <p><a href=fullmoon.html>The Cheesehead Full Moon Hash</a> is a separate disorganization which has its own style. 
				Unfortunately, it is just as f*cked up as MH3, just in a different way.
				Cheesehead runs on the evening of a full moon (or the evening before or after) but never on a Saturday.
					  <a name="bikes">Badgers on Bikes</a>
				This is a BASH which is just like a hash except on bicycles. 
				<a href=madbash.html>Badgers on bikes</a> ride the second Sunday of every month at 4 PM.
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="span4">
				<h2>Fees and Dues</h2>
				<p>Hash Cash is only $5 a week, payable at the beginning of the run. This is one of your entertainment bargains and is much cheaper than therapy.
				To become a member in good standing,
				pay your dues (only $15 a year), and set a run or two during the year.

				</p>
			  
			</div>
			<div class="span4">
			  <h2>Visitors</h2>
			  <p>In case you are used to hashing elsewhere... There is only one rule in Madison: "There are no rules." 
				It doesn't matter what the weather is, the hash is ON. Almost all of our runs are pre-set (there is rarely a live hare).
				Ceremonies are not conducted in a circle, you don't have to put your beer on your head, point with your elbow, or sit on a block of ice. But we like to think that we have fun.
				Yes, we sing songs. But Madison likes to keep it short. After all, there
				are beers to drink. Our half minds have trouble remembering anything
				over 4 lines long.

				<h2>Badgers on Bikes</h2>
				<p>This is a BASH which is just like a hash except on bicycles.

				<h2>First timers</h2>
				<p>"How do I hash?" Just show up with a crummy pair of running shoes, you nitwit. The <a href="default.html">home page</a>
				shows the location of the next run. 
				If you are cumming for the first time and insist on being five minutes
				early, don't worry, someone will likely be there eventually. You will be referred to a "virgin", a "new boot" or by your first name prefaced by "Just" as in "Just John" or
				"Just Julie" whereas we will have fancy hash names like "Prince Variant" and "Way Too Soon". 
				An irreverent sense of humor is more important than any running skill. There is a LOT of stopping
				and standing around during a hash trail because the pack does not know where they are going.
				There is also at least one beer check (stop). So it is easy to keep up even if you are novice jogger or out of shape. Be forewarned that the trail will most likely deviate from "normal" running paths so it may be possible to get your shoes wet or muddy and there may be an occasional burr or thorn. It is not a bad idea to bring a change of clothes. 
				Hashing is NOT for you if you think getting there first is the goal or if you are easily offended. Not only is there a trail run, there is food, ceremonies and more. Expect to be having fun for at least three hours after the 
				start of the run.

				</p>

			<div class="span4">
				<h2>Drinking</h2>
				<p>Since it IS a drinking club, you must be 21 years old to participate. And since you are an adult, you are in charge of your own alcohol consumption. Downs-downs or the chugging of beer
are part of ceremonies. And Madison always pours a proper measure - no dixie cups used here.
However, we never force anyone to drink. You have two options: 1. fill a cup with water and drink that.
2. Choose a "champion" who will drink for you. At the end of the evening, make sure you are sober before you drive (<a href=http://www.cityofmadison.com/police/BACcalc.html>Drunk? Calculator</a>). If not, walk home, bum a ride, grab a cab or hook up with the host or hostess.

<h2>Trail Marks</h2>
Trail marks are indicators of where you are supposed to run.
Flour and chalk is used on the ground. <span class="emph">Verbal calls</span> are also listed here.
	<table class="table table-striped" >
		<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><img id="markpic" src="img/dollop2.jpg"><br />dollop<br /><img id="markpic" src="img/arrow.jpg"><br />follow me</td>
			<td>A "mark" or "dollop" is a splash of flour, or an arrow, and indicates that you are probably on trail. Runners who believe that that they are on trail, should shout
			<span class="emph">"On, On"</span>. Lines and arrows are also sometimes used to give directions.
			Toilet paper can be used in tree branches when you can't see the ground.
			</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td ><img id="markpic" src="img/check.jpg"><br />Check</td>
			<td>A "Check" looks like a X and means the trail can go in any direction. So go check. If you are not sure someone ahead of has gone the correct way, you can yell <span class="emph">"Are you?"</span>. They may reply <span class="emph">"Checking"</span> (meaning I don't know yet), 

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td ><img id="markpic" src="img/false.jpg"><br />

			False </td>
			<td>A "False" is a circle and means the you have gone the wrong way. Get thee back to the check and try again. Note that is is possible to see one or more dollops before you find the false.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img id="markpic" src="img/backcheck.jpg"><br />

			Back Check</td>
			<td>A "Back Check" is an X superimposed on a circle and means the the trail
			has veered off from the direction you have gone. You will need to back
			track to figure out where to go next.
			<br />
			If a number of people have really gone the wrong way, the hare or a friendly
			hashers may call <span class="emph">"On Back"</span> to get you to run around.
			If you hear <span class="emph">"Car Back"</span>, get out of the middle of the road! Please be aware and considerate of cars. They are bigger than you and everybody has a cell phone to call police if you are running in a dangerous manner.

			</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td ><img id="markpic" src="img/bc.jpg"><br />Beer Check</td>
			<td>A "Beer Check" is a BC on the ground. Stop and have a beer.</td>

<p>
"Beer Near" is a BN. The hare is a bastard and is going to make you look for the beer. Remember "Near" is a relative term.

<p>
If you see "On In" written the ground, you are almost done and final destination should be clear. Or not.
<br>

Sometimes the trail will lead into shiggy.
"Shiggy" is any off-road area that you normally would never think of running in. Such as but not confined to fields, construction sites, 
muck, and swamps. However, you should follow the marks.<br /><br />

Listen at the beginning of the run for instructions from this
week's hare. They may have special variations or more likely just don't
know what the hell they are doing. When in doubt, follow the pack.
Under no circumstances should you follow Slow Hand.

<a name="Commandments"></a>The Ten Commandments of the Madison Hash</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Remember the HASH day to keep it holy. EVERY Saturday at 5pm (3pm in winter).
<li>Thou shalt follow the HARE's trail, for the HARE will lead thee to a land flowing  with beer and sustenance.
<li> Thou shalt make NEW BOOTS cum, for by this shalt the HASH HOUSE HARRIERS be fruitful and multiply and have dominion over all the earth.
<li> Thou shalt not whine, for I will smite the whiners with shin splits and light beer and with every other pestilence.
<li>Thou shalt not pee upon thy fellow HASHERS, for I have given thee the trees and bushes that thou might pee upon.
<li>When thou art HARE, thou shalt provide much wine and merriment, for so doth thou do the true work of the Lord.
<li>Thou shalt not SIP SIP SIP thy beer during ceremonies, for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.
<li>Thou shalt not spill thy beer upon the ground; verily I say unto thee, it is better to cast it into the belly of a lush than to spill it on the ground.
<li>Thou shalt not throw the HARE into the fire to be burned, yea, though the trail be long and shaggy, with many false trails and little flour.
<li>Thou shalt moon. Lo, I say unto thee, by this sign shalt all the world know that thou art my people.
</ol>
