					<h2>Hash date: 12-1-12 - HASH RUN #1844</h2>
					<p> </h2>
						There is a spectacular tiled shower built into an attic-like spot of the second floor of Mr. and Mrs. Sizzle's house. It is mostly white four-inch ceramic with deep relief. It covers the walls and a 9-by-12 pitched ceiling. The floor is made of smaller multi-colored high-gloss pieces.<br /><br />
						It's puzzling that the most admired feature of this elegant bathroom would be the underside rim of what was once a serviceable but common potentiometer. <br /><br />
						Several guests knelt Saturday evening to get a closer look at the piece.
						Numbass had prepared an elegant meal earlier in the evening, but none who partook questioned his culinary skill nor connected the meal to those who bowed repeatedly and called dinosaurs through the great white telephone.<br /><br />
						But I'm getting ahead of myself. <br /><br />
						You see, several of those attending this quiet gathering had attended a committee meeting the night before.<br />
						A pre-committee meeting started with music and dancing at the Cardinal Bar moving later to the Come Back Inn. There was food and drink and boots, and before long, the owner of the establishment began to hover.
						Behind us, a group of young women were trying to have a bachelorette party. They appeared to be women who no longer cared for each other but had gathered to acknowledge a dark passage. 
						They were a quiet crowd. We would have ignored them entirely, but then one of them began to lick the cream off the tip of an illuminated penis-filled glass. One might call that the tipping point, but just the tip.
						It occurred to many of us that these confused individuals needed help. Several of us offered to remove clothing and dance on the tabletop.<br /><br />
						Confused and uncertain about what they were celebrating, the bachelorette party passed their gift bag to us. We were already having far more fun than they, and we hadn't even started to sing yet.
						Printed on the bag was a completely unchecked bucket list of things to do before the night was through. Things like: Dance on the table, Dance with a stranger, Get someone to buy you a drink, Get someone to remove their shirt, and Give Jeff Daniels a blow job.
						Krack a Showa realized that hashers always appear to be at a bachelor or bachelorette party and are, in fact, professionals in this regard. The hash should form a business, sort of a lame-party rescue service. 
						Friday bled into Saturday. Reports from the field note that Howie Feltersnatch hosted a successful Hash with Mr. Rhythm setting a remarkably shitty trail through rolling hills west of Madison. Sources say Just Dan was named PussyChoker after killing a kitten when he thought no one was looking.
						"Why?" you ask, "Are you telling me all this?"<br /><br />
						It is to provide context. You see, something magnificent happened Saturday night. Something wonderful and if I should die, or drink again before it is shared, it will most certainly be forgotten. 
						We have an extraordinary artist among us. (And by extraordinary I mean, extra ordinary.) It is Lady Disexual and she revealed her talents to the world on the canvass that is Footthong.
						I arrived at the home of the Sizzles and let myself in. It was rather early. There were a number of shoes lined up on the porch but the house was oddly quiet. I entered and looked to the left. A pair of pants was sitting on the dining room table. I scanned the floor for blood and the room for other signs of fowl play. I moved quietly to the kitchen. There, I found Footthong. He was drinking wine from a bladder while wearing SizzleMeTitters night clothes. 
						"Footthong!" I placed my hands on his head and pulled him in to engage his eyes.<br /><br /> "Footthong! Are you there? What have you done with Sizzle and is she naked?"<br /><br />
						He belched and half spat at me and said, "She's upstairs with the others consoling Mr. Sizzle. He's curled into the fetal position, rocking gently in a corner. He's weeping because I'm wearing Sizzles night clothes and I've forever ruined them for him."
						It was worse than I thought. It was a true emergency. Something had to be done. One needed to act fast! I found a beer in the fridge. Fortunately, it was a Winter Skal and a twist off. There would be no fumbling for an opener.
						I dashed to the stairs, climbing them three, four, maybe even one at a time. But I was too late. Mr. Sizzle was already reversing gears in the bathroom. Numbass was in his bed.
						I returned to the living room. "By now Lady Di, Rhythm and PussyChoker had arrived. Footthong was snoring shirtless on the floor. <br /><br />
						That's when it happened. <br /><br />
						Lady Di took a bottle cap and cut open her right index finger. She hummed softly as black blood oozed from her and she began to draw a butterfly tramp stamp above Footthong's ass.
						We were mesmerized, in a trance, perhaps. Who can say how long it took for her to transform Footthong, front and back, into a work of art; days, hours, a few minutes? No one can say.
						And then, miraculously, Footthong woke up.
						"Hey! Let's go to Mickey's!"<br /><br />
						And we did. And Poopeye was there. Have you ever seen that guy play pool? It's awesome.

					<h2>Hash date: 11-17-12 - HASHGIVING </h2><br />- BLOWN DRY + BONE AGAIN<br /><br />
					<p> </h2>
						Though I very much wanted to attend Hashgiving, I had given it up as lost. I had parental responsibilities and many months ago had vowed never to let my children near these people. But as the afternoon wore on, my attitude changed.<br /><br />
						I have a soon to be five-year-old. He suggested a nap early in the afternoon and, trying to be a good parent, I played along. He stripped naked and pulled a feather duvet around him. I played my part and tried to sleep. But there was something else on his mind.<br />
						"I'm going to touch my nipples," he said.<br /><br />
						He grabbed the imperceptible flesh on his chest with his pencil-like fingers and pulled outward.
						"You can touch your nipples too," he said.<br /><br />
						I declined and tried to reinforce the idea of the nap with deep breathing. He talked a bit about the  comparative size of nipples but getting no feedback, changed the topic by pretending to be a robot. 
						There would be no nap.<br /><br />
						I thought, there is no reason this child could not attend a hash.<br /><br />
						He was, at first, excited about the idea of running and following clues, but that thought quickly gave way to digging holes in the ground with a wooden sword.
						I am most thankful to the hosts of Hashgiving for accommodating his presence. <br /><br />
						Hours later, I reconnected with Hashgiving at the Carribou.<br /><br />
						Pecker Meche offered me the last of his gin and tonic and said this:<br /><br />
						"I love gin and tonic. There is something magical about it. A shot of gin, on its own, is horrible. But combined with tonic, it soothes your stomach. It's like when you were sick as a child and your mother gave you soda. Plus," he said. "It gets you drunk."<br /><br />
						A smaller contingent moved on the to the Great Dane, where everyone was even more thankful.<br /><br />
						Just Sarah encountered a "dancing man." He moved about the room in a daze, violating everyone's personal space. Just Sarah decided to dance with him. Unfortunately, this only encourage "dancing man" to become all the more sexualized and emboldened to touch and grind with pretty much everyone else in the bar as he shook his thang about the pub.<br />
						Numbass, who just the night before had lifted and cradled several full-grown hashers in his arms, spinning them around as if babies, was on the prowl. I will admit to being one who was carried and cradled close against his tight, hard chest. His hard bicips dug into my back awakening what I can only describe as my "mangina."<br />
						He approached a table of young women, and said simply, "You are beautiful." He retreated and reported to the group.  <br />
						His overture was met with little response.<br /><br />
						Perplexed that such a specimen should get so little in return, I approached the same group and told them they were hideous. <br />
						"Do you really think this look works for you all? How can you think this is effective? Go home and look in a mirror for crying out loud."<br />
						This, oddly, broke the ice and was exactly what they wanted to hear, although one said she would now need years of therapy.<br />

					<h2>11-03-12 Anniversary Run</h2><br />- reported by Jeff Daniels the Chicken Fluffer<br /><br />
					<p>
						 it was a good party. I'll give you that. <br />
					But does everyone need to so effusively cum on your leg? <br /><br />
					The trail was so fantastically shitty that several bodies will be found in the months to come. Who will answer for that? Not me. I've covered my tracks.<br /><br />
					As for the On In, I thought the ice sculpture lacked a certain, je ne sais quoi: No one has butt cheeks like that and if they did, beer certainly would not pour forth from them. <br />
					Lobster should be cooked in salt water to preserve the flavor of the meat.<br /><br />
					Foie gras should not be prepared from unfluffed fowl that live near sewage ponds.<br /><br />
					It's understood that "the house always wins" but no one should have to mumbley peg with body parts when their luck is down.<br /><br />
					It is all well and fine to thank the tavern, but I think the grandchildren should be released.<br /><br />

					<h2>Hash date: 10-26-27.12</h2><br />- reported by Jeff Daniels the Chicken Fluffer<br /><br />
					<p>
						 The landing parties infiltrated a number of environments on the hash surface including Mcfaraway, the Ale Asylum and the Essen Haus.<br /><br />
						Communication was sporadic, but somehow, the teams coalesced and odd local customs were observed. <br /><br />
						In retreat, the crew encountered many distressed natives, but one in particular gave the crew pause. Alone, scantily clad, (ok, maybe thats why we stopped) and huddled against a brick wall for warmth, the poor creature could barely speak. Combining various levels of remaining sobriety, the team helped this creature operate a "cell phone" and speak to some asshole who was probably the reason she was so shit faced in the first place.<br /><br />
						The crew, ill prepared for the climate of the planet surface, braved wind and cold keeping the distressed and incoherent native awake until some guy showed up.<br /><br />
						Given the parade of puke and distress witnessed on the journey back to the ship, and the challenges of ensuring the safety of the landing party itself, I believe special commendation is in order for those involved.<br /><br />
