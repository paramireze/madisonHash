/*****Before you do anything else when coding a website, you should reset the styling.

A lot of designers clear the styling with a global reset, but there’s a problem with doing this. Form buttons and fieldsets are among the few elements that are completely destroyed with the global reset. They lose their native styling that goes beyond the browser. Instead, you should pick-and-choose the elements you want to reset. It also makes it easier to apply your own style to common elements.
